## Getting Started
### 1. Start the Database

First, start the PostgreSQL database using Docker:

```bash
# Start the database
docker-compose up -d

# To stop the database
docker-compose down

# To view database logs
docker-compose logs -f postgres
```

The database will be available at:

- Host: localhost
- Port: 5432
- User: postgres
- Password: postgres
- Database: learn_anything

### 2. Run the Development Server
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed the database (optional)
npx prisma db seed

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
### 3. Install Ngrok and Set Up Clerk Webhook

Clerk uses webhooks to notify your application about authentication events. To test this locally, you need **ngrok** to expose your development server.

Follow the steps 1, 2 and 3 from this link.
https://clerk.com/docs/webhooks/sync-data

The SignIn Secret key should be set as WEBHOOK_SECRET in the environment file.
